<p>
My name is Natalie Tan. I am a student of Dunman High School. Currently in 1st year high school. </p>
<p>
  <h1> Introduction</h1>
<p>
  I am a person who is very curious; eager to find out more in depth and detail. I like to seek for different perspectives before making a solid conclusion on a situation. When I come across any problems, I choose to think critically and differently to find the best way possible to solve them. When it comes to learning, I am a very slow learner. But I believe that speed, though important, is not the most important. At the end of the day, what matters most is the final outcome and my understanding of the topic. Being a very meticulous person, I will not be contented unless I get the job done perfectly with minimal errors and more details.
